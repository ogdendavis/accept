      <p>“Since its start in 2016, the ACCEPT Facebook Group has grown to over 4,800 members dedicated to promoting equity and access for all students. The group&rsquo;s founders&mdash;Marie Bigham, Steve Frappier, and Brandi Smith&mdash;were recently recognized for their successes, with Facebook naming ACCEPT as one of its top 100 groups in 2017. And the group&rsquo;s influence is not limited to its online presence. ACCEPT&mdash;which stands for Admissions Community Cultivating Equity &amp; Peace Today&mdash;has hosted local programs for students, developed affiliate and NACAC conference sessions, and convened in-person meetings around the country.”</p>

      <p>“Creating real and lasting change is difficult, but this year’s President’s Award recipient managed to do it in warp speed. She stared by posting a simple statement: “It is time for us as a professional community to take action against rampant hate and inequity,” and she proposed a facebook group to do just that... Without her unbridled passion, enviable patience, and relentless persistence, ACCEPT would neither have been born nor nurtured into the community of 4,000 it is today.”</p>

      <p>“More than 1 billion people around the world use Groups, and more than 100 million people are members of ‘meaningful groups’ [such as ACCEPT]. These are groups that quickly become the most important part of someone’s experience on Facebook. Today we’re setting a goal to help 1 billion people join meaningful communities like these.”</p>
